title: "DATA 622 - Machine Learning and Big Data"
---

Machine learning consists of a set of models and algorithms that allows us to derive insights, discover patterns, and make predictions of complex phenomenon by adapting to training data.
The development and widespread adoption of machine learning over the past decades has led to a revolution in wide variety of domains, including business, health care, government, economics,
and the sciences. In this course we will learn the fundamentals of machine learning, from linear models to regression trees and deep neural networks, the fundamental trade-offs between 
different models, how to evaluate and compare models, the differences between causal inference and prediction, and how to put models into production.
